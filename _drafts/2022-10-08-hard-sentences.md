In a sarcastic response, Zelenskyy posted a Twitter poll of his own asking "which Elon Musk do you like more?": "One who supports Ukraine" or "One who supports Russia."

Musk replied to Zelenskyy that "I still very much support Ukraine, but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world."

"My recommendation… would be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won't make everyone happy," he told the Financial Times.

"YOUTH" 
Samuel Ullman
Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.

Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of sixty more than a boy of twenty. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.

Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.

Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing child-like appetite of what's next, and the joy of the game of living. In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station; so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the infinite, so long are you young.

When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at twenty, but as long as your aerials are up, to catch the waves of optimism, there is hope you may die young at eighty.

The march for wage increases and other demands was organized by left-wing opponents of Macron and lit the fuse on what promises to be an uncomfortable week for his centrist government.

Transport strikes called for Tuesday threaten to dovetail with wage strikes that have already hobbled fuel refineries and depots, sparking chronic gasoline shortages that are fraying nerves among millions of workers and other motorists dependent on their vehicles, with giant lines forming at gas stations.

State fires back at Biden administration’s demand to remove shipping containers filling hole in border

The administration of Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is pushing back against a demand by the Biden administration that it take down a number of shipping containers it has used to plug a gap in the incomplete border wall, saying that border states "cannot rely on the federal government to ensure its security."
亚利桑那州州长道格·杜西(Doug Ducey)的政府拒绝了拜登政府的一项要求，即拆除一些集装箱，这些集装箱被用来填补不完整的边境墙的一个缺口，称边境各州“不能依赖联邦政府来确保其安全”。

The bureau had written to Gov. Ducey’s office last week, arguing that the move in August to fill nearly 4,000 feet of gaps in the border wall with shipping containers topped with razor wire is illegal. Ducey had announced the filling of the gaps in early August.

### Black Man Informed He Pretty Articulate For A Fundamentally Subhuman Life Form
SALT LAKE CITY—After he astonished a coworker who previously thought what she was witnessing was nearly impossible, sources confirmed Wednesday that a local Black man was informed he was pretty articulate for a fundamentally subhuman life form. “Wow, it’s nice to meet an innately inferior being who is so well spoken,” said Pam Jensen, who works with the Black man at Beckstead Media Solutions, adding that she had assumed, upon seeing her colleague’s skin color, that she would have to communicate with him through a series of overt physical gestures and simple, loudly spoken phrases. “What a pleasant surprise! To be honest, when I walked into the room just now and saw there was a primitive creature of limited intelligence in here, I wasn’t even expecting you to be coherent, let alone eloquent. For a moment there you had me thinking you might not be a savage beast who deserved to die in the street, but that’s silly, of course!” At press time, the Black man had reportedly been reprimanded by HR for using his broad command of language to thoroughly curse out his coworker.
